# Behavioral Design Patterns

Pick two of the behavioral design patterns from class and write the code needed to implement them for a situation of your choosing. Like last week, it doesn't have to be anything crazy, but make sure it's a learning experience for you.

## Patterns

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

## Example Ideas

1. Create an iterator for a linked list (aka write a super simple linked list)
2. Implement an observer pattern using individual people objects subscribed to a store object listening for when toilet paper comes back in stock
3. Create a template method for building a house and extend it with two classes that make unique houses using the template
