# Fulfilling Assignment requirements

After reviewing the slides, the lecture, and documentation of behavioral design patterns, I decided that the best "learning experience" for nme would be to pick two behavioral design patterns (as stated in the requirements) and thoroughly read through the documentation for each. After doing so and finding two that I felt like I could follow and understand well, I dissected the Python code examples and ran them in my terminal to understand the output. This was a better learning experience because it got me familiar with a correctly coded pattern rather than trying to code one on my own from scratch. This way, if I ever run into a use case for a pattern in the future, I know right where to look for it and how to understand it.
