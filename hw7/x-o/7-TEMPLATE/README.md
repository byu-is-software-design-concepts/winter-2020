# X's and O's

## Setup

In this directory, run `npm install` in order to install the required packages.

The code is located in the `src` folder.

Run `npm run test` to verify if tests are passing or not.

## Instructions

Write the function `isXAndOValid(str)` to check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any letter.

- For example
  - `ooxx` should return `true`
  - `xoxx` should return `false`
  - `xxooplkarjaja` should return `true`
