## Setup

In this directory, run `npm install` in order to install the required packages.

The code is located in the `src` folder.

Run `npm run test` to verify if tests are passing or not.

## Instructions

The Fibonacci sequence, named after mathematician Fibonacci, is a sequence of numbers that looks like this:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 19`

You get first two starting numbers, 0 and 1, and the next number in the sequence is always the sum of the previous two numbers.

You should write the function `getFibNumber(steps)` that returns a number from the Fibonacci sequence, based on the parameter `steps`, which determines the position in Fibonacci number.

- For example
  - `0` should return `0`
  - `4` should return `3`
  - `15` should return `610`
