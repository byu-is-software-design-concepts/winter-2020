# Zeroes

## Setup

We're now going to use Jest for the tests in our homeworks. In this directory, run `npm install` in order to install the required packages.

The code is located in the `src` folder.

Run `npm run test` to verify if tests are passing or not.

## Instructions

Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

- For example:
  - `[false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]` should return `[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]`
