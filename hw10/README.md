# Structural Design Patterns

Pick two of the structural design patterns from class and write the code needed to implement them for a situation of your choosing. Doesn't have to be anything crazy, but make sure it's a learning experience for you (i.e. this assignment doesn't do anything for me long term, so make sure it does something for you).

## Structural Patterns

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

## Example Ideas

1. Create a flyweight for building a forest to be rendered for a video game
2. Create an adapter for a legacy system/class that has employee information stored as separate attributes to be used with a system that wants the data as a JSON string
3. Create a composite handling individual employees and manager employees (in charge of a set of employees) and add functionality to "pay" them on payday
