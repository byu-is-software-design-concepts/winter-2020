# Big O

## Instructions

1. Copy the template file over into your submissions directory.
2. Go through each function and calculate the time complexity for each one.
3. Make whatever comments you need to tell someone reading why you think your answer is correct.

I've already put my solution in the submissions folder (`clark-branden/big-o-problems.js`) for you to look at when you need help.

## Example

``` javascript
// Answer: O(n) or linear
function example(input) {
  // Loops through every item in the input once => O(n)
  for (let i=0; i < input.length; i++) {
      console.log(input[i]);
  }
  });
}
```
