# HW 2 Instructions

## Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to help you apply using Big O notation and practice addressing technical problems.

## Format

Just like last time, you'll do all your work in `hw3/_submissions/lastName-firstName` and then push it to a remote branch on GitHub. Instructions for `big-o` and `persistence` are found in their respective `README.md`.
